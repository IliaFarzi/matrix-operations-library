Here's a comprehensive `README.md` file for your matrix operations library, covering SDK features, decoupled logic, and example execution.

# **Matrix Operations Library**

A flexible and extensible C# SDK for performing matrix operations. This library supports matrix-to-matrix operations, scalar-to-matrix operations, and matrix properties like transposition and determinant calculation. The design follows SOLID principles, ensuring that the logic is decoupled from the implementation of algorithms, allowing for easy swapping or extending of functionality.

---

## **Features**

### **1. Matrix-to-Matrix Operations**

- **Dot Product:**  
  Calculates the dot product of two matrices.

  ```csharp
  double dotProduct = matrixService.DotProduct(matrixA, matrixB);
  ```

- **Cross Product:**  
  Calculates the cross product of two 3D vectors represented as matrices.

  ```csharp
  var crossProduct = matrixService.CrossProduct(matrixA, matrixB);
  ```

- **Matrix Sum:**  
  Adds two matrices element-wise.

  ```csharp
  var sumResult = matrixService.Sum(matrixA, matrixB);
  ```

---

### **2. Scalar-to-Matrix Operations**

- **Scalar Multiplication:**  
  Multiplies every element in a matrix by a scalar value.

  ```csharp
  var scalarMultiplyResult = matrixService.ScalarMultiply(matrixA, 2);
  ```

- **Scalar Addition:**  
  Adds a scalar value to every element in the matrix.

  ```csharp
  var scalarAddResult = matrixService.ScalarAdd(matrixA, 5);
  ```

---

### **3. Matrix Properties**

- **Transpose:**  
  Transposes a given matrix (flips rows and columns).

  ```csharp
  var transposedMatrix = matrixA.Transpose();
  ```

- **Determinant:**  
  Calculates the determinant of a square matrix (only for matrices of type `double`).

  ```csharp
  double determinant = matrixA.Determinant();
  ```

---

## **Decoupled Design**

This library is designed following the **Dependency Inversion Principle** from SOLID. All matrix operations are defined via interfaces, and the concrete algorithm implementations are injected into the service layer. This means:

- You can easily **swap algorithms** without modifying the core logic.
- **Extend functionality** by adding new algorithms implementing the provided interfaces.
- Keep the **business logic clean** and **separate** from specific implementation details.

**Example:**

To switch to a custom dot product algorithm, simply implement the `IMatrixDotProductAlgorithm<T>` interface and inject it into the `MatrixOperationsService<T>`.

```csharp
var customDotProductAlgorithm = new CustomDotProductAlgorithm();
var matrixService = new MatrixOperationsService<double>(
    customDotProductAlgorithm,
    crossProductAlgorithm,
    sumAlgorithm,
    scalarOperationsAlgorithm
);
```

## **Getting Started**

### **1. Prerequisites**

- [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0) or higher

To check if .NET is installed:

```bash
dotnet --version
```

### **2. Run the Example**

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/matrix-operations-library
   ```

2. **Run the Example:**

   Use the following command to run `program.cs`, which demonstrates basic matrix operations:

   ```bash
   dotnet run program.cs
   ```

### **3. Example Output**

```plaintext
Dot Product: 70
Matrix Sum:
6 8 
10 12 
Scalar Multiplication:

## **Extending the Library**

To add a new matrix operation:

1. **Define an Interface** in the `interfaces` folder (e.g., `IMatrixInverseAlgorithm.cs`).
2. **Implement the Algorithm** in the `algorithms` folder (e.g., `MatrixInverseAlgorithm.cs`).
3. **Inject the Implementation** into `MatrixOperationsService`.
